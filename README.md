# ChessNet-Engine
The goal of this project is to use deep learning methods—more especially, convolutional neural networks—to develop an intelligent chess engine. The algorithm gains tactical awareness and strategic knowledge by learning from top-rated chess games. This method focusses on pattern recognition and positional knowledge akin to human players, in contrast to standard chess engines that mostly depend on brute-force calculation.
The project creates an accessible platform where players may challenge and learn from the AI by fusing deep learning (PyTorch) with contemporary web technologies (React, Flask). While actively striving to enhance its comprehension of opening theory, the system exhibits a particular strength in middlegame positions and endgame play.
